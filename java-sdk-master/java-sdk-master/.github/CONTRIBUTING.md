# Building and testing
This project uses [Gradle] as the build tool (> v1.x). Here are some helpful commands:
```sh
cd java-sdk
gradle jar  # build jar file (build/libs/watson-developer-cloud-6.14.0.jar)
gradle test # run tests
gradle check # performs quality checks on source files and generates reports
gradle testReport # run tests and generate the aggregated test report (build/reports/allTests)
gradle codeCoverageReport # run tests and generate the code coverage report (build/reports/jacoco)
```

# Pull Requests

If you want to contribute to the repository, here's a quick guide:
  1. Fork the repository
  1. Edit the [`config.properties`](../common/src/test/resources/config.properties) file to add your service credentials to the appropriate fields.
  2. develop and test your code changes, gradle: `gradle test`.
    * Run `checkstyle`: `gradle checkstyle`. üèÅ
    * Create minimal diffs - disable on save actions like reformat source code or organize imports. If you feel the source code should be reformatted create a separate PR for this change.
    * Check for unnecessary whitespace with git diff --check before committing.
  3. Make the test pass
  4. Commit your changes:   
    * Commits should follow the [Angular commit message guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines). This is because our release tool uses this format for determining release versions and generating changelogs. To make this easier, we recommend using the [Commitizen CLI](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) with the `cz-conventional-changelog` adapter.
  5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request to the **master** branch
